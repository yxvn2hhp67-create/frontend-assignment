Mambu UI – Frontend Skeleton (React + Vite + TypeScript)

This sub-project is a minimal React + Vite + TypeScript setup intended as the starting point for a candidate’s frontend take-home task.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- A package manager (npm comes with Node; yarn or pnpm also work)

Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Run the dev server: npm run dev
3. Open the printed local URL (typically http://localhost:5173)

Build & Preview
1. Production build: npm run build
2. Preview the built app: npm run preview

Project Structure
- index.html – Vite entry HTML
- src/main.tsx – Application entry
- src/App.tsx – Example component
- src/styles.css – Minimal styling
- vite.config.ts – Vite configuration
- tsconfig.json – TypeScript configuration

Notes for Candidates
- You may install additional libraries as needed (state management, UI kits, testing, etc.).
- Keep your code clean and readable. Prefer small, focused components.
- If assumptions are necessary, document them briefly in this README.

Notes for Interviewers
This skeleton is intentionally minimal. Adjust dependencies or add starter files if your exercise requires them (e.g., routing, API client, testing setup).
